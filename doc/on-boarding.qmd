Here we would love to show a collection of good advices and
intro-material for new members of the research group.

At the moment it is very rudimentary, but away you go!

## Teams

The group has a team chat and space on Microsoft Teams. If you're not
already a member, [please apply
here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3azPnPvVesd14A0c17QcULwshWEQqdi4dgXr3mLNIhvok1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=0c900c5c-f177-47d4-946a-17c8338c2758&tenantId=61fd1d36-fecb-47ca-b7d7-d0df0370a198).

## Learning programming

For a reproducible data management, analyses, visualisation and writing,
programming is the way to go. *R* covers the whole spectrum, but you can
also use different programs for each step.

There is a plethora of resources for learning programming for use in
health science and it can be difficult to decide where to start. In this
group the preferred languages are Stata or *R*.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is a great place to start for open
languages (not Stata, but *R*, Python, Julia or something more exotic),
where everything can run in the browser and you donÂ´t need to download
anything. You can track your progress and get hints. It's also a great
place to practice after you got the hang of the basics, remembering [the
Law of the
instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument):

> "If the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat
> everything as if it were a nail."

### On reproducible writing

Here are some advices on academic writing in RStudio (the very popular R
editor, that does much more than just that) with Quarto: [Some Quarto
PDF formatting tips, with particular reference to thesis
